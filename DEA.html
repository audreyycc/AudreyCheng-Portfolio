        <p>
            <!-- so basically, we started with the like concave dea thing that the lab had alr come up with. initially 
            used tesla valve as a one way valve, didn't work well though. so i iterated off of that, worked through
            a bunch of versions that used tesla valves. decided that it wasn't feasible after those failed, came up
            with sequence of deas to create a one way valve. "hacked" a custom switch box that was really just a 
            bunch of relay reeds. modified labView code to individually activate multiple DEAs separately, then created
            the sequence. similarly to the initial design, used solidWorks to design and print molds. then casted CN9028 
            elastomer, assembled w deas to build pump structure. then tested, and tested again. had to make modifications
            to the mold/pump structure as well as placement of the deas themselves.  -->
            This project was conducted in the Clarke Lab at Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Science and advised by Professor David R. Clarke.  
            The project was completed through the Program for Research in Science and Engineering at Harvard College during the summer of 2024. 
            I am currently developing the final design further to work with the liquid metal alloy eGaIn.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <h3>Published in the HSURV 2023 Abstract Book</h3>
        <p>
          Soft robotics provides flexibility and adaptability ideal
          for creating versatile, responsive technologies suited for
          use in contact with human beings. The objective of
          this project is to develop a soft pump using a design
          for dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) we previously
          developed, which morphs into a hemispherical shape in
          response to an applied voltage. The multilayer DEAs are
          constructed by spin coating CN9028 acrylic elastomer
          onto an acrylic substrate followed by stamping carbon
          nanotubes over the elastomer using circular PET masks
          of varying diameters, repeating these steps to form five
          layers. The pump structure is constructed by pouring
          elastomer into 3D printed molds, using additional elastomer
          to attach both sides of the mold and DEAs together.
          Initial pump designs failed to induce uniaxial flow when
          using Tesla valves to control the flow, likely due to the
          size of the liquid channels, slow flow rate, and structure
          material. We removed the Tesla valves and modified
          the design to use multiple DEAs arranged sequentially as
          valves. The modified structure uses two outer DEAs which
          actuate downward in sequence into the fluid channel to
          control the liquid flow direction. A central DEA acts as a
          pump. Using LabView to program the DEAs to actuate in
          specific sequences, the pump moves liquid uniaxially with
          partial success, though the efficiency of fluid movement is
          currently inconsistent. The interaction between DEAs has
          been identified as a critical factor affecting the system’s
          performance. Current considerations to improve the pump
          include varying the thickness of the DEAs, number of diode
          layers in each DEA, and the distances between the DEAs
          on the pump structure to enhance unidirectional flow and
          overall reliability. Successful development of the soft pump
          will allow for its integration into a tunable antenna system
          using the liquid metal alloy eGaIn, which has applications
          in wearable electronics and medical devices
