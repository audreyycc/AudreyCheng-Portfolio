        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
          This project was completed as part of 2.009 Product Design Process at MIT. Our team was made up of 16 undergraduates. In addition to 
          design and build responsibilities, I also acted as a co-Story Officer, working on product branding and team social media. 
          Throughout this project I practiced 3D CAD and FEA in Fusion and machined parts using tools including a manual mill and horizontal bandsaw.
          I also used Adobe Suite (Illustrator, Photoshop) for various Story Officer tasks.

        <h2>Product</h2>
        <p>
          DORI is a deployable propeller guard intended for use on recreational motor boats. While existing stationary prop guards reduce fuel efficiency 
          and decrease speeds, DORI allows boaters to prioritize safety without compromising performance.
        </p>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>

        <h3>Ideation, research, and conceptualization</h3>
        <p>
          We began brainstorming product opportunities by observing real-world problems and interviewing professionals in various fields of work. 
          After discussing our ideas as a team, we narrowed them down to the six most feasible product opportunities. In smaller subteams, 
          we researched each of the six opportunities and analyzed their consumer desireabilty, technical feasibility, and business viability before 
          further narrowing down to four concepts. After lots of group discussion, decision matrices, and further research including interviews with
          potential users, we decided to move forward with the deployable propeller guard concept. 
        </p>

        <h3>Iterative design</h3>
        <p>
          Our original use case was based on sailing school instructor motorboats. Students who fall off the instructor's boat or nearby sailboats
          and get swept under the boat are easily injured by the propeller. As such, our device required fast deployment and sensing capabilities to detect 
          a person in the water near the propeller. 

          We initially planned to mount our device to the transom at the back of the boat and intended to use a linear rail system to deploy the guard, 
          but after realizing that the outboard rotates as the boat changes directions, we decided to mount to the midsection of the outboard instead. 
          We built cardboard mock-ups of several designs and chose our final design based on its compactness (conversations with potential users made it clear that 
          boaters prefered minimal bulkiness) and relative simplicity (only required one axle to actuate and didn't risk collision with the transom). 

          Since our concept required fast deployment, we chose pre-loaded springs as our actuation method and decided to use a sonar sensor mounted 
          underneath the front of the boat. We then designed the guard in fusion and machined parts, primarily by waterjetting and manual milling. 
        </p>

            <p>
                After feedback from course staff and internal team discussion, we decided to alter our use case, making the project more feasible given our timeline.
                Our new use case focused on recreational motorboats entering dangerous areas (i.e. mixed-use areas, swimming areas), which also helped to broaden our
                potential user base. 

                Given this change, we eliminated the sonar sensor system from our device. We also decided to use hydraulics to actuate our guard, since hydraulic systems are 
                already commonly used on motorboats, so they are well-suited to marine environments and boaters are already familiar with them. 
                We modified a double-ended hydraulic cylinder sourced from a motorboat steering kit, shortening its length to decrease the bulkiness of our overall assembly. 

                We chose to use a rack and pinion to translate the linear motion from the hydraulic ram to the rotational motion 
                needed to deploy the guard. After CADing the assembly in Fusion, we made engineering drawings for each part before machining.

        <h3>Verification and validation</h3>
        <p>Once we'd built the full guard, we did FEA on the guard in Fusion and conducted tests in a tow tank to compare drag for our device versus a 
           commercial propeller guard (a plot of this data is included in the left column). We found that our current guard experiences about 2x the drag force of a typical 
           commercial guard. However, our guard will remain stowed out of the water, preventing it from effecting fuel efficiency until deployed. </p>

        <h3>Commercialize</h3>
        <p>
          Leading up to our final presentation, we finalized our UI and focused on polishing the overall product. 
          We decided to use a mechanical hand crank installed at the helm of the boat to deploy the guard, with a hard stop to signify to the user that the 
          guard had been fully deployed. We also developed our product brand, including naming our product and designing a logo.
