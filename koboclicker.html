        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
            KoboClicker was designed for Harvard Humanitarian Initiative (HHI). HHI is a nonprofit organization
            that works to advance humanitarian aid globally through educational initiatives and research. 
            Learn more about their work by visiting <a href="https://hhi.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">hii.harvard.edu</a>.

        <p>
            This project was completed as part of ENG-SCI 96: Engineering Problem Solving and Design Project at 
            Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Science. The course pairs a team of engineering students 
            with a client to identify client-specific challenges and engineer solutions. 

            Through this project I practiced rapid prototyping and design for manufacturing, primarily using Onshape to build 3D printed models.

        <h2>Product</h2>
        <p>
            KoboClicker is a handheld device made to interface with HHI's surveying software, Kobo Collect, to make 
            in-the-field data collection faster, easier, and safer. Currently, field researchers hold tablets to collect data, 
            making them potential targets of theft, or use single-input manual tally counters, which are not capable of direct input into Kobo Collect.

        <h2>Design Process</h2>

        <h3>Investigate and Ideate</h3>
        <p>
            We began by getting to know HHI through client meetings and research into their organization's mission and structure. 
            We worked through a number of brainstorming exercises to develop an organized understanding of the client 
            and to identify commonalities between the challenges we'd seen from our meetings and research.
            After organizing the problems we'd pinpointed into categories, we developed a comprehensive problem statement.
            We then brainstormed dozens of project ideas to address the problem we'd defined before narrowing down to a select 
            five. Once we'd met with the client for feedback, we decided on KoboClicker. Our decision was based on a pugh matrix 
            with criteria including mission impact, user value, technical feasibility, budget, ethical privacy 
            and security risk, scalability and maintainability, client feedback, adoption likelihood, and team enthusiasm. 

        </p>

        <h3>Design and Prototype</h3>
        
        <p>
            Our team of 16 worked in three subteams (mechanical, electrical, and software) and I acted as co-mechanical team lead. 
            Within our subteam, we chose to think about the form and function of our device separately. While the electrical
            and software subteams worked out the necessary hardware we'd need to incorporate into the first prototype of our device,
            we focused on designing a manufacturable and ergonomic form. We looked at existing devices with similar functions
            and ergonomic features, and deconstructed a VR remote and stopwatch to better understand their designs. 
            We also worked on button placements, experimenting with different layouts to determine which was most comfortable 
            and intuitive for users. 
        </p>
        <div class="centered-img">
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/KC_form.png" class="img-fluid resized-img">
            <div class="caption">Ergonomic device design</div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Once the device's electronics were functioning, we began to design a mechanical shell for the first prototype of KoboClicker.
            Because the prototypical breadboard we were using was so large, we enlarged and simplified our shell structure. 
            
            We designed and optimized systems for button mounting, housing the electrical components, and water resistance. For each element,
            we brainstormed solutions, built preliminary prototypes/samples to test and analyze, and chose the best-fit design to refine.
        </p>
        <p>
            For our final assembly, we cut our breadboard down in size, allowing us to reduce the final dimensions of our device. The device 
            has eight buttons mounted to its top face. The user interacts with cylindrical pillars that interface with electrical push buttons
            on the internal breadboard and feature o-rings for improved water resistance. It uses a frame-like structure to internally house 
            the electrical components (micro SD and battery) and ports on its outer face for usbc charging and micro SD access that include
            silicone inserts for water resistance. The lid snap-fits tightly onto the base of the device, with an o-ring between the two pieces. 
            
            For future iterations and manufacturing purposes, we intend to build a custom pcb to fit into our existing ergonomic design, 
            as well as a rigid grid structure to replace the more flexible frame.

                <div class="caption">Cylindrical pillars designed for user interaction with electronics</div>
            </div>
        </p>

        <p>
            We rapidly prototyped our shell out of 3D printed PLA and designed primarily in Onshape. We cast our o-rings for 
            water resistance out of silicone. 

            Challenges included lead times for parts (we wound up designing and building custom button caps and o-rings),
            and variable accuracy and tolerancing issues with 3D printed parts.
        </p>

        <h3>Verify and Validate</h3>
        <p>
            Most of our specs were inherently met through our device's design. We conducted a drop test, verifying that the device could withstand
            a drop height of at least 3ft, and water resistance test.
